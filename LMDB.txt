Lightning Memory Map Database (LMDB)

-Transactional Database : A transactional database is a DBMS that can reverse or scale back a database transaction or activity if it isnâ€™t performed correctly.

-ACID Properties :

1. Atomicity - The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all
2. Consistency - The database must be consistent before and after the transaction
3. Isolation - Multiple transactions occur independently without interference
4. Durability - The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs
 
-Named Database : A database with a logical name that allows users to identify it without knowing its location. Max database size must be specified.

-Multiversion concurrency control(MVCC) : Multiversion concurrency control, is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory. (read-write lock) (readers never block)

-Crash proof structure

-Highly optimized and extremely compact

-Runs on most modern operating systems

-Concurrency Support : 

1. multi-process and multi-threading
2. single writer and n readers
3. No deadlocks (because only a single writer)

-Supports nested transactions and batched writes

-Full isolation eith MVCC - Serializable

-Copy on Write (COW)

-Uses single level store
