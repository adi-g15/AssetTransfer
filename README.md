**Development of a universal yet flexible consensus algorithm supporting the participation of IOT and mobile devices** 


This repository contains an application which has the ability to transfer assets from one user to another. It works on the platform Hyperledger Sawtooth and is based on an example application 'Intkey' present in the Sawtooth core repository. 

Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed ledger applications and networks. The design philosophy targets keeping ledgers distributed and making smart contracts safe, particularly for enterprise use. The reasons which differentiates Sawtooth from other platforms are:

1. Separation Between the Application Level and the Core System
2. Private Networks with the Sawtooth Permissioning Features
3. Parallel Transaction Execution
4. Ethereum Contract Compatibility with Seth
5. Pluggable consensus algorithms
